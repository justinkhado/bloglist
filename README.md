## Built With
### Frontend
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
### Backend
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

## Installation 

Clone the git repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justinkhado/bloglist.git
```
Since the frontend and backend are in separate directories, the node modules for each are installed separately.
### Frontend
From the root directory,
```
cd bloglist-frontend
npm install
```
### Backend
From the root directory,
```
cd bloglist-backend
npm install
```
## Quickstart
To run this application, start the frontend and backend on separate servers.
### Frontend
In the bloglist-frontend directory,
```
npm start
```
### Backend
In the bloglist-backend directory,
```
npm run dev
```
Although, it's not necessary to run the backend in development mode, it helps with seeing any issues that may occur.
